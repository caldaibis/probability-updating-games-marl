# Multi-agent reinforcement learning for relaxed probability updating games

This is the repository corresponding to the Master Thesis "Investigating relaxed probability updating games". It contains the code for the mechanics behind general-sum probability updating games and provides a wrapper to port such games to OpenAI Gym-like environments. Using Ray Tune and Ray RLlib, it implements PPO and other policy gradient learning methods in a decentralised manner on these games.
